          <p>
            I write monthly technical blog posts at
            <a href=""> HarpCode</a> about various technical topics. Writing a
            blog helps me freshen up on my technical writing skills as well as
            fortify my learning of a topic. If you haven't made a blog or
            created content, I suggest finding a some sort of content creation
            to log your learning. It also is a great way to see how far you have
            developed!

            Hi, I'm Andrew Harper, a Front-End Web Developer based in the
            States! I'm an enthusiast with a passion for helping people who
            enjoys incorporating my interests in education, music, and design
            with my coding skills. My experience with programming has been a
            constant journey since I was a kid. I remember I used to disassemble
            my family's old computers and be in awe of all the parts that were
            used to make it work. As a kid, I was never able to put them back
            together, but eventually that curiosity turned into a hobby of
            building computers which then turned into an interest to code. It
            wasn't until my early to mid twenties that I would learn how to code
            and realize how much I enjoyed it while I was pursing a degree in
            education. Since then, I've been learning Javascript and React and
            anything that peeks my interest. I have recently completed
            FreeCodeCamp's Javascript Bootcamp, MIT's CS50, and I am currently
            taking other self-taught classes to keep improving my skills to
            continue in my aspiration to be the best programmer I can be. I'm
            seeking a remote role where I can help a team achieve their goals.
            My passion in coding is to one day create fun interactive
            educational resources for all people!
