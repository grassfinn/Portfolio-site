## Things I learned.

I learned about classes a little more and used them in making the cards you see on my site. I don't know  for sure if I did it the optimal way, but I can see how classes can be useful.

I practiced more on how to append items and nest elements to the dom to make a more dynamic site.

I learned the basics of grid layouts in CSS.

How to use key-value pairs in an class or object and display them onto the document.
